// Welcome to my Gallup Winter Project. Contained in this Git Repository are a few essential compoents of my project.
// The first thing I include, in the SQLSetter.java file, is the tables that the program will create whenever various activities are performed.
// Next, I included another portion of my script that provides a sample of what the program's auto-generated resumes could look like.
// Please, feel free to direct any questions to torres.eduardo.steven@gmail.com
